This group is represent2d by a relatively small number of buildings
(about 30) which follow conservative building traditions which were well
astablis~ed in St. Louis by the ti~e tl,ey were constructed. Approxi~ately
one-fourth are detached two-story, two-bay red brick houses (one has a stone
first story) usually with a side-Jabled (sometimes with a single dormer) or
flat roof, although one example employs a front-gabled and anot:1er a half
hip~ed; cornices are usually wood mociillioned or brid denticul,1tcd; all
e!11ploy segment2lly ~rc!1ed cpenings except one vhich e11ploys stone lintels and
another with cast iron lintels; all but on2 feature side entrances (Photos

houses al~ost all of ~hich appear to have !)een built for t~o families; they
usually feature a side-gilbled roof; all are jotachcd c~cept one six-hay

cornices are v10od modillion2d (?hotos }S, fourth, fifth, sixth and s2venth

at 1705 Lafayatte is the only three-story example; it is also distinguished by
a clcssically det1iled ,1ood entrance enfra~1cment (Photo {6 second fro~ right).
An~th2r atypical exa~1ple at 2229 Park feQtures cast iron lintels and a two
story frame porch (originally with cast iron railings) (Photo f7, second from

arched 0~2nings with t~o doors located either in the center bays or at t!,e end
bays; all are detached and display flat roofs and brick denticulatad cornices.
One four-bay, multi-family building at 1901 Pari: rises three stories; the
first story is i nsta 11 ed with a cast i ran storefront. !\n attached ro·:1 of
three five-bay multi-fa1:iily buildings at ]IL24-34 Dolman (listed in the
