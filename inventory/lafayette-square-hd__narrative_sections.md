This group is represent2d by a relatively small number of buildings
(about 30) which follow conservative building traditions which were well
astablis~ed in St. Louis by the ti~e tl,ey were constructed. Approxi~ately
one-fourth are detached two-story, two-bay red brick houses (one has a stone
first story) usually with a side-Jabled (sometimes with a single dormer) or
flat roof, although one example employs a front-gabled and anot:1er a half
hip~ed; cornices are usually wood mociillioned or brid denticul,1tcd; all
e!11ploy segment2lly ~rc!1ed cpenings except one vhich e11ploys stone lintels and
another with cast iron lintels; all but on2 feature side entrances (Photos

at 1705 Lafayatte is the only three-story example; it is also distinguished by
a clcssically det1iled ,1ood entrance enfra~1cment (Photo {6 second fro~ right).
An~th2r atypical exa~1ple at 2229 Park feQtures cast iron lintels and a two
story frame porch (originally with cast iron railings) (Photo f7, second from

arched 0~2nings with t~o doors located either in the center bays or at t!,e end
bays; all are detached and display flat roofs and brick denticulatad cornices.
One four-bay, multi-family building at 1901 Pari: rises three stories; the
first story is i nsta 11 ed with a cast i ran storefront. !\n attached ro·:1 of
three five-bay multi-fa1:iily buildings at ]IL24-34 Dolman (listed in the

r:oe1prising approxinately 100 examples, this grou;) is largely represented
by detachec: hm-story single-, two-, three-, and four-fccmi ly hous2s
articulated in Queen Anne, Romanesque and Georgian/Colonial 2evival styles.
Typical features includ,:, irregular plans, hipped or coupound hip~ed and gabled

development of Lafayette Square had been excluded in the original nomination.
The present revised nomination has extended the boundaries to include those
properties.
Background:
In 1835, the Missouri State Legislature authorized the City of St. Louis
to sell the St. Louis Commons, a large tract of undeveloped land situated
southwest of the city limits. The following year, at the urging of Mayor
Darby, some thirty acres of the Common were set aside as a public square
bounded by streets 120 feet wide. To the east and west of the Park, the
streets were named Mississippi and Missouri Avenues; to the north and south,
Park and Lafayette Avenues, respectively (Figure 1). In 1854, the public
square was renamed Lafayette Park at the suggestion of Charles Gibson and
Steven D. Barlow, early District landholders and members of the Park's Board
of Improvement, who selected the name for its association with General
Lafayette, a visitor to St. Louis in 1825.
As early as 1837 portions of the Commons near the Park were surveyed and
subdivided into blocks which were purchased by speculators who correctly
anticipated the city's potential for future growth. Stimulated by an influx
of foreigners, St. Louis' static population in fact had tripled between 1830
and 1840. Germans alone accounted for 5000, or an estimated thirty percent of
the city's total population by 1840 (16,469); the number of Irish was also
steadily growing. This period of dramatic growth continued, surging to an
annual increase of close to 11,000 persons in the 1850s. Early purchasers of
acreage in Lafayette Square included immigrants from England, Ireland and
Germany as well as native-born, some of whom were purely speculators while
others settled on the land and opened subdivisions.
From the earliest period of settlement the District developed as a mix of
working-class and middle-class residents who built homes according to their
means. The presence of the Park and the splendid vistas afforded by the
elevated land attracted business and professional men seeking suburban
residential sites. Gardeners, farmers, dairymen, craftsmen and skilled
laborers also found the area suited to their needs with its abundant land
located near developing industries. The District thus evolved with multiple
parallel building histories, some of which were progressive, introducing new
styles to St. Louis; some conservative, tied to local vernacular practices;
the majority, however, represented middle-class design preferences popular at
the time.
Community Planning:
By the 1850s frontage along the south side of Lafayette Avenue across from
the Park had been purchased and was being improved with extensive landscaped

grounds and Italianate villas of the latest fashion (all demolished) by such
men as Edward Bredell, President of the Missouri Glass Works, Archibald Gamble
and his son-in-law Charles Gibson, both prominent attorneys, and hardware
merchant John C. Rust (Photo #58, right). These men and others were
responsible for subdividing and promoting the south and east sides of the Park
as a "first class" sector of "substantial and permanent family residences" (as
opposed to "tenements for boarders and small fam lies") where "some taste is
1
displayed in their construction and adornment." Toward this end they agreed
to sell lots with a minimum frontage of 40 feet, and to place deed
restrictions on the lots prohibiting the construction of dram shops, iron
foundries, soap, candle or vitriol manufacturies, hemp factories, livery
stables, houses of public entertainment, etc .• Charles Gibson, whose 1851
towered Italianate mansion fronted the east side of Easton Place (now Waverly
Place) was among the early subdividers of land on the south side of Lafayette.
His Lafayette Addition (opened in 1859) extended south along both sides of
Preston Place almost to Geyer Avenue. Although Preston Place was dedicated to
public use, Gibson reserved the right to close the street in the event that
any authority should attempt to extend or widen the street or to open another
street in the Addition. Adjoining Preston Place on the west was Park Place
(now the 1700 block of Mississippi) laid out by lawyer and theater magnate
Solomon Smith (Photo #58, right; and Figure 1, far left). An 1859 report of
auction sales indicated the premium prices commanded by lots in this section
of the District: $65 per front foot on Lafa2ette; $34 to $42 per foot on
Preston Place and $53 per foot on Missouri.
The establishment of Preston and Park Places followed by a few years the
creation of Lucas Place (1851), once located some distance north of Lafayette
Square. Lucas Place was the first of St. Louis' most exclusive private
"places" which eventually formed a central corridor westward to the city
limits. Deed restrictions which governed Lucas Place were more stringent than
those attached to lots on the southside of Lafayette. They dictated a set
back of twenty-five feet, placed ownership and maintenance of the street with
lot owners and limited traffic to pleasure vehicles. The prestigious aura of
the Place was quickly imitated as numerous new subdivisions throughout the
city adopted ''Place'' to their names although fewer carried deed restrictions.
The need for deed restrictions to protect the small early "Places" in
Lafayette Square was prompted by the proximity of Christian Staehlin's brewery
(razed), established by the late 1850s on the south side of Lafayette Avenue
just east of Preston Place. The appearance, in the 1850s, of small rope and
slaughter house industries in the District's northwest quadrant no doubt
accelerated a movement led by Charles Gibson to control development of a much
larger area around the Park. In 1863, the State Legislature passed a law
designed to preserve and promote the District as a quality residential

largest house, 1705 Lafayette (Photo #6, second from right), is a three-story,
three-bay brick building with stone lintels built around 1865 by lumber dealer
James Luthy, a native of Virginia. According to a later critic, this building
type was considered in the 1860s to be the "topmost limit of respectability
•• , the limit of every man's ambition" in St. Louis where the "spirit of the
people is antagonistic to almost all kinds of outward show, and the pro~ress
is slow to the display which every St. Louisan finds in other cities."
Further down the block are three double-family houses at 1717-19-21
constructed in the early 1860s for assistant auditor Christian Garrell, bank
cashier Henry Hoffmann and wholesale grocer William Oebike, respectively. The
houses display three-bay facades with slightly pointed stone linteled openings
and wood modillioned cornices (Photo #6, fifth, sixth and seventh from right).
Similarly detailed houses with flat stone lintels are to be found at 1713
Lafayette (erected by the St. Louis Mutual Building Co. #2 in 1873) and in the
1000 block of Dolman Street (Photo #50, left). Another group of single and
multi-family houses illustrall=s a very common 19th century vernacular classical
tradition in St. Louis. Segmentally arched openings, brick denticulated or
modillioned wood cornices and gabled or half-hipped roofs are the primary
characteristics of these modestly detailed buildings. Examples include 1310
Missouri Avenue (Photo #8), a four-family flat built in 1876 by painter John
D. Tobin, and 1512 Mississippi, a house fronting on the Park constructed in
1878 by Lorenz Lampel for Philippine Lampel who lived there following her
marriage in 1880 to Zachariah Wainwright Tinker, secretary of the Tinker &
Smith Malting Co •.
During the mid-1860s a new direction in domestic architectural design was
taking root in Lafayette Square as Italianate/Renaissance Revival and the
closely-related Mansard or Second Empire style houses began to appear. While
the Italianate style was already popular in middle-class St. Louis housing,
the mansard -roofed Second Empire was virtually unknown. According to the
Missouri Republican, only one building in the entire city boasted a mansard
until the spring of 1866 when the "mansard roof fever" began and soon became
the rage, "when it was discovered that this trick of ?rchitectura 1 adornment
cost very little more than the old way of building." Lafayette Square was
one of the first neighborhoods in St. Louis to introduce and widely adopt the
mansard roof. Among the early houses displaying a French roof, five were in
Steven D. Barlow's Addition of 1857 which fronted along both sides of Kennett
Place and the north side of Lafayette between South Eighteenth (formerly
Second Carondelet) and Mississippi (Photo #59, left).
The first mansarded house in Barlow's Addition was probably 1554
Mississippi; the building permit was issued in 1866 to lawyer George F. Hume
for a "two-story French roof brick house" costing $12,000. (The mansard was
removed in 1885 and replaced with a third story). Barlow's own house (razed)

on the southeast corner of Kennett Place and Mississippi was constructed
around 1867 with a mansard. In the spring of 1869, an advertisement appeared
for an auction sale of three double-houses on Kennett Place, all on corner
lots, "beautifully terraced and enclosed by stone and iron fences;" 6 the only
one standing today is 1800-02 Kennett Place, featuring swell-fronts in the
end-bays; it was owned in the 1870s by Hessian-born Morris Langsdorf, a
retired dry goods merchant. Several other Second Empire houses appeared
slightly later at 1842 and 1838 Kennett Place, built circa 1871 for Bavarian
born Simon Strauss and Bohemian-born Leopold Lowenstein, partners in a
wholesale millinery business. Fine Italianate designs also lined the street,
including 1834 Kennett Place, built about 1875 for Charles Wezler, a Bavarian
born wholesale liquor dealer (Photo #10, right foreground) and 1831-29-27
Kennett Place, a row of three detached two-bay houses constructed in 1878 by
iron manufacturer John Pullis and occupied respectively in 1880 by hat dealer
Albert Rothschild, Polish-born William Zukoski, a wholesale millinery
merchant, and retired iron manufacturer William W. Pullis, (Photo #10, left
foreground). The fronts of the Kennett Place houses are all faced with smooth
dressed ashlar stone, frequently employed with Italianate and Mansard houses
elsewhere in the District. The common use of stone facades, previously
reserved for the wealthy, began around 1870-71 when the De Soto, St.
Genevieve, Carroll County and Warrensburg quarries were developed, making
stone as nearly inexpensive as brick. 7
Architecture/Community Planning:
Another early enclave of Second Empire houses sprang up directly opposite
the north gate to Lafayette Park in Benton Place where eight houses standing
there by 1875 exhibited the new roof (Photo #59, upper right) and eventually
all but two of the eighteen 19th century houses (two were demolished) employed
mansards (Photos #31, #32). The Subdivision was platted in 1868 by lawyer
Montgomery Blair, a landowner and resident of the area in 1850, whose long,
distinguished political career kept him in Washington for many years. Modeled
after Lucas Place, deed restrictions imposed on Benton Place lots were more
stringent than any previous ones in the District; they established the street
as a private place owned jointly by property holders who were annually
assessed for maintenance of the street, alleys and park strip. A common
building line of twenty-five feet from the street was set by deed along with
provision for a Board of three Commissioners. Stone entrance gates marked the
Park Avenue end of Benton Place while the north end was closed. The unique
design of the Place with its oval center island enclosed by a curvilinear
drive may have been suggested to Blair by landscape architect Maximilian Kern
who was working in Lafayette Park at the time, or possibly by surveyor Julius
Pitzman who, in addition to Benton Place, laid outnost of the city's later
private places. The entrance gate and center island marked advances in design
over Lucas Place, features which subsequently were employed in exclusive

Vandeventer Place (1870) in the central corridor.
The twenty-five foot front lots in Benton Place sold for an unusually
high price of $3000 to $3500 each. The largest single group of lots was
transferred from Blair to banker William H. Maurice, who paid $75,000 for over
twenty-one lots in 1870. A Pqrk Avenue resident since 1860, Maurice was one
of the first Commissioners in Benton Place and a member of the Board of
Improvement for Lafayette Park from 1859 to 1874. His brother, architect John
H. Maurice, had worked in his native New York state before taking up practice
in St. Louis in the late 1850s. He designed at least four houses in Benton
Place: #21 for John H. Cavender, real estate partner of Edward S. Rowse who
also invested heavily in Benton Place lots; 2115 Park Avenue (Photo #33), a
circa 1874 design closely related to #21, for commission merchant George Bain;
2051 Park Avenue (circa 1870) for bank President James S. Britton; and #35
(1873) for bank President Dewitt C. Stone. Other houses in Benton Place have
been attributed to English-trained architect George I. Barnett who designed
the Second Empire Governor's mansion (1871) in Jefferson City.
Testimony to the success of the private place concept as it was early and
widely developed in Lafayette Square were the numerous bona fide Places with
closed privately owned streets which, by the late 1880s, had mushroomed
throughout the city, along with the flock of imitations, announced as Places
in city directories but which in reality were public street,gwhere "garbage
carts and lumber wagons rumble past their doors every day." The District's
last private place fully deserving of its name was opened in late 1875 by
Scotsman David Nicholson, importer of fancy groceries. Platted with fifty
foot lots, Nicholson Place extended south from Lafayette Avenue (See
Architectural Survey Map) and was reserved for the ''exclusive use and benefit
of proprietors of lots." The street and alley apparently were maintained by
Nicholson himself as no provision was made for assessment and a condition of
the plat stated that the ground they occupied was to be considered Nicholson's
private property, as were water and gas pipes. Deed restrictions dictated a
set-back of fifteen feet and introduced a new requirement for private streets
specifying that buildings must be stonefronted. Stipulation of stone for
facades, while governing only houses in Nicholson Place, nonetheless was a
significant indicator of St. Louis taste of the time. In Lafayette Square,
the stonefront continued to be so extensively employed that the neighborhood
gained an unusual cohesiveness and special identity. No other neighborhood in
the city survives with such a large number of stonefronted houses.
Throughout the 1870s and well into the 1880s the Italianate and Mansard
styles dominated house design in Lafayette Square making it one of the city's
showcases of middle-class housing in these styles. Numerous streets were
built up with impressive rows (Photos #5, #11-#13, #15, #26, #28-30, #34,

#35). Virtually no city block is without one or more examples. Builders
ranged from Prussian-born carpenter Louis Luth who constructed three, three
bay houses at 1624-22-20 Dolman in 1877 and resided in one of them (Photo #15,
right foreground) to prominent lawyer William S. Pope, who built ten, three
bay houses (circa 1870) as investment property at 1100-1118 South Eighteenth
Street on land owned by his father-in-law, Henry C. Moore (Photo #11).
Another prolific builder, wealthy widow Winnefred Patterson, owned and
subdivided, in 1871, the east half of City Blocks 484 and 485 which she
improved in the mid-1880s with stonefront Italianate and Mansard houses along
Rutger and Hickory Streets (Photo #26) and with a pilastered brick commercial
building at 1817-19 Park. Unfortunately building permits issued before the
early 1890s rarely name architects or contractors. However, architects of a
few houses have been identified from various sources, including 2012
Lafayette, built in 1878 for William S. Simpson by Alexander Cameron (who
undoubtedly designed his own house at 1550 Mississippi); 2004 Lafayette,
designed circa 1874 by August Beinke for flour merchant August Guye; and 1425,
1427, 1431 Missouri, designed by John Maurice for Jacob Christopher who
speculatively built the houses in 1882. A group of twelve three-story
Italianate houses (most with stonefronts) constructed in the late 1870s and
early '80s at various locations on the periphery of the Park are among St.
Louis' few remaining examples of the building type. A particularly fine
example was erected in 1878 for German-born tailor Charles Bauer at 2018
Lafayette, distinguished by windows of diverse shape on each story, a bold
cornice and a cupola on the roof (Photo #19).
Landscape Architecture:
Improvements to the Park initially were undertaken by nearby residents
who, by 1852, collected $8000 for construction of a "rough paling fence" to
keep out stray animals. Some trees and shrubbery were planted and various
caretakers were hired (unsuccessfully) in exchange for the right to cultivate
a portion of the park for private gain. It was not, however, until 1864, when
the services of Maximilian G. Kern, the Park's first professional landscape
gardener, were secured that the grounds were transformed into a showcase of
the city. Born and trained in Germany, Kern (1824 - c. 1915) worked in the
Royal Gardens in Stuttgart and the Tuilleries in Paris before emigrating to
the United States in 1848. For a time he was associated with Adolphus Strauch
at Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery. In 1855, Kern published one of the
relatively few nineteenth century treatises on landscape gardening, a
theoretical and practical work which, along with his later treatise of 1884,
earned him a respected place in the history of American landscape
architecture. Both works attest to the author's endorsement of eighteenth
century English picturesque landscape traditions as practiced by Humphrey
Repton in England and Alexander Jackson Downing in America, and expound
principles which shaped the design of Lafayette Park. 9

Lafayette Park was the first St. Louis public park to be artistically
developed and apparently Kern's first major project in this country. When he
arrived, the park grounds offered few desirable natural contours, a-'flat,
uninteresting field with a high rugged bank of clay at the north side." At
Kern's direction the clay bank was graded down, an existing lake in the center
of the Rark was enlarged and deepened and rolling hills were built up with the
soil. 1. A system of meandering walks was laid out presenting a sequence of
vistas, and trees, shrubbery, lawns and flowering plants were carefully
selected and placed by Kern (Photo #59 and Figure 2). A fountain and pond
were installed at the west side of the Park (Photo #60). In 1867, a music
stand and a one-story police station were constructed; the station was
enlarged in 1870 with a mansarded story for the use of the Board of
Improvement; it survives at the southeast corner of the Park (Photo #59,
upper left; Architectural Survey Map). A competition held in 1868 for the
design of a fence and entrance gates was won by architect Francis Tunica; the
iron fence enclosing the Park (Photo #52) was fabricated by P. J. Pauley &
Bro. of St. Louis; the entrance gates were constructed of Glencoe marble on
red freestone plinths. The first of two commemorative statues was installed
in 1868 near the center of the park where it stands today: a ten-foot bronze
statue of Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton executed by sculptress Harriet
Hosmer. The following year one of five bronze copies of Houdon's statue of
Washington in Richmond, Virginia was erected on a marble pedestal near the
south boundary of the Park (Photo #52). It was reported that the statue would
be surrounded by a P.arterre of flowers and thirteen vases representing the
original colonies. 11 During Kern's tenure as Superintendent (1864-69) the
park was embellished with various other ornamental structures including a
rustic bridge, pagoda and cottage, none of which are still standing. In later
years Kern acknowledged Lafayette Park as one of his proudest achievements.
It was further significant as a model for his work in other St. Louis parks
including Forest Park, the nation's fifth largest urban park.
Architecture: Early Institutions, Commercial
The cultivation of the Park, coinciding with the end of the disruptive
Civil War years, had provided impetus for the surge of development which
previously had been rather spotty. Within the next decade two public schools,
two churches, and several commercial and industrial structures had been
erected in the District along with the substantial number of houses (Photo
#59). In 1868, Clinton School, the oldest extant public school building in
St. Louis, was completed at 1109 Grattan Street. The three-story, twelve
room, red brick building featured Italianate styling with round-arched
windows, a wood modillioned cornice and projecting center entrance bays (Photo
#23). Peabody School (razed) was opened in 1872 at the southeast corner of
Carroll and South Eighteenth Streets. By the mid-1870s, each of the two

schools boasted an enrollment of over 1200 students. While only a few
students were foreign-born, close to one-third were of German parentage and
enrolled in German language classes offered in both schools. Occupations of
parents listed in a 1876 School Board Report showed the greatest number
engaged as merchants, followed by mechanics, a larger than average number of
professionals, manufacturers and clerks, and a fair samplif,9 of laborers,
boatmen, butchers, farmers, gardeners and saloon keepers.
The District's two earliest churches, offshoots of large churches in the
city's central corridor, were established to serve the growing population on
the south side. Both were designed by architect Frederick W. Raeder in
similar Gothic Revival styles. The cornerstone of the Unitarian Church of the
Unity at 1322 MacKay Place was laid in 1869 and the rock-faced stone 35 X 60
building was dedicated the following year. Three of the church's original
incorporators, E. S. Rowse, William H. Maurice and J. S. Cavender,were
instrumental in developing Benton Place, adjacent to the east. Red brick
St. John's Episcopal Church, completed in 1872 on the northeast corner of
Hickory and Dolman Streets (Photo #46), shares with Church of the Unity a
facade articulated with a center Gothic-arched entrance flanked by lancet
windows, and a large Gothic window above. Both buildings are among the city's
earliest remaining churches in the Gothic Revival style.
By the early 1870s a second brewery and adjoining beer garden had located
in Lafayette Square on the west side of Mississippi between Chouteau Avenue
and Hickory Street (now the site of the International Shoe Co. buildings).
Owned by Joseph Schnaider, the brewery was just outside the 800 foot distance
from the park which was protected by law from such establishments. The beer
garden became one of the city's favorite summer recreational spots, offering
music and dramatic performances in addition to refreshments. The first
section of the one- and two-story red brick A. M. Dolph Laundry at 1511-19
Vail Place was built in 1879 with additions in the 1880s and '90s. Originally
from Cincinnati, the Dolphs were first established downtown on Walnut Street
before expanding the business to Lafayette Square, perhaps to service the
hotel once located nearby on the southeast corner of Park and Mississippi.
Architecture: Final Developments
The last large tract of land to be developed lay directly west of the
Park encompassing the north half of City Block 2139, all of City Block 2141
and the south half of City Block 2139. The land was platted in 1875 as
Funkhouser's Lafayette Park Addition; principal landholders were commission
merchants Robert M. Funkhouser and Moses L. Pottle, and Robert B. Whittemore,
dealer in wholesale millinery. No deed restrictions were imposed on the lots
and although the streets were publically maintained, both Whittemore and
Albion (formerly Pottle) were listed as Places. One of the first buildings

in the Addition was the Lafayette Park Presbyterian Church, a large Gothic
Revival stone building of 1881-83 on Missouri Avenue which was sited to
advantage on the Park. It was designed by architect John Maurice, a member of
the congregation (Photo #18, left).
As a. result of the late and rapid development of Funkhouser's Addition
(most houses were constructed between 1882-92), it exhibits the District's
largest single concentration of Revival style houses. The houses also clearly
illustrate the transition from Italianate/Mansard design to new Revival forms
and materials -- a phenomenon which could be observed in similar neighborhoods
at that time. As the Survey Map indicates, about half of the buildings are
typical District examples of Italianate or Mansard styles; these include
stonefront Mansards built in 1879 at 2342 and 2344 Whittemore, and in 1884 at
2332 and 2340 Whittemore. However, 2335 Whittemore (erected in 1884 for
lawyer Leo Rassieur) while still mansard-roofed, adopted Queen Anne style
features observable in its asymmetrically massed plan and red pressed brick
facade embellished with a corbelled brick cornice and stringcourses, and
pierced with a broad arched parlor window with art glass transom. By the late
1880s, red brick facades were displacing stonefronts and Queen Anne and
Romanesque Revival forms had overtaken Italianate in popularity (Photo #41).
Similar trends are observable in other parts of Lafayette Square as in the
1884-85 Mansard/Revival attached rows at 1723-27 Carroll built by match
company superintendent August Eichele (Photo #36) and at 1826-34 Lafayette,
erected in 1885 by John H. Kaeser, an upholstery goods merchant (Photo #37).
By the 1890s, red brick, Revival-styled facades were also commonplace on more
modest housing such as 1424 through 1436 South Eighteenth Street (Photo #42)
and 1413-15 Dolman (Photo #43), all designed in 1891 by architect Ernst
Preisler. Many of the city's leading architects received commissions for
1890s and turn-of-the-century District Revival houses, including Theodore
Link, Otto Wilhelmi, E. Jungenfeld & Co., Grable & Weber, Ernst Janssen
(Photo #38) and Boston architects Peabody & Stearns who designed #10 Benton
Place in 1892.
On the evening of May 27, 1896, a tornado touched down at Jefferson
Avenue, bringing grave consequences to the Lafayette Square neighborhood. In
addition to personal injuries and deaths, many buildings were totally
destroyed while numerous others lost walls and roofs. All the trees in
Lafayette Park and Benton Place were destroyed. Despite enormous financial
losses, the neighborhood quickly set to work rebuilding and repairing homes
and churches and eventually new buildings replaced those beyond repair. By
1904, the Park had been sufficiently replanted to receive a special
commendation from foreign landscape architects who were visiting the St. Louis
World's Fair.

Although damage wrought by the tornado caused some residents to elect to
leave for other parts of the City, a demand for housing continued and
institutions remained strong, evidenced by the large, handsome Romanesque
Revival design by architect William A. Cann for the Lafayette Park Methodist
Church completed in 1902 (Photo #45). In 1904, the church boasted the largest
Sunday School in the City. Simpson Place, the District's last subdivision,
was opened in 1902 by Jacob Christopher and William Simpson, brothers-in-law
and partners in one of the city's leading architectural iron works. Both men
had built commodious Romanesque Revival houses in 1893 (designed by architects
Grable & Weber) on the southwest and the southeast corners of Lafayette Avenue
and Simpson Place - a tract of land they had purchased in 1890 from Edward
Bredell whose 1850s mansion stood in the center of Simpson Place until
construction of the Christopher and Simpson homes. No deed restrictions were
required for Simpson Place since the subdivision remained family-owned well
into the twentieth century. Simpson began building rental housing on the east
side of the street in 1902; only one house was left standing after Interstate
44 lopped off the south end of Simpson Place.
Turn-of-the-century construction also brought three sizeable new
industries to the District which significantly expanded employment
opportunities for area residents. In 1903, the largest, Robert, Johnson &
Rand Shoe Co. (later International Shoe Co.) erected the first building of
their 1903 - 1922 complex, located on the site formerly occupied by Joseph
Schnaider's beer garden at the northwest corner of Hickory and Mississippi.
The five-story, 60 by 350 foot building featured a functionally efficient
design in red brick with long ranges of regular fenestration (Photo #55,
right). A year earlier, the American Bed Co., incorporated in 1900 for the
purpose of manufacturing iron beds, cots, wire spring mattresses and couches,
constructed the first factory of the 1902 - 1919 complex sited on the
southeast corner of McNulty and Vail Place. The two-story brick building
features fenestration rhythms similar to those of the shoe factory (Photo
#54). In 1910, the Zittlosen Manufacturing Co., producers of tents,
tarpaulins, wagon and lawn umbrellas and cotton duck, located in a new three
story Craftsman style brick building at 1332 Dolman, expanded to the north in
1915 (Photo #22, far right).
A considerable amount of the housing stock built in the early twentieth
century was concentrated on the south side of the Park where it replaced
1850s mansions or filled-in vacant estate grounds. Similar Craftsman-styled
buildings, however, can be found dispersed throughout the neighborhood, where
they improved vacant lots or replaced tornado-damaged buildings. The new
housing generally maintained the size, scale, proportions and materials
commonly employed in late nineteenth century buildings, but eliminated the

vocabulary of ornament. Typical St. Louis Craftsman buildings employ flat
roofs with terracotta coped parapets or false gabled overhangs, and feature
rectangular openings with soldier course brick lintels; cornices are simple
bands of wood, brick or metal (Photos #49; #50, right; #51; #52; #53).
Fortunately the District was spared from teens and twenties high-rise
apartment buildings introduced in other city neighborhoods. The largest
District building of the period, erected 1913-14 on the southeast corner of
Lafayette Avenue and Waverly Place, maintained the three-story height limit of
the nineteenth century neighborhood (Photo #52).
The last few buildings constructed in Lafayette Square are of interest as
they encapsulated quite disparate but parallel design traditions expressed in
contemporary new construction around the city. Representing Revival style
taste of the 1920s, the Deutsches Haus, a community house for St. Louis
German-American societies, was completed in 1928 at 2343-45 Lafayette from
plans drawn up by architect Jacob Heim. The large, three-story buff brick and
terracotta trimmed building was reported to be modeled after Heidelberg
Castlef3 onion-domed dormers and elaborate stepped-gable parapets effectively
evoke German ancestry (Photo #48, left). Another twenties Revival example,
Lafayette Park Baptist Church at 1916-26 Lafayette, is articulated in a red
brick and white terracotta Tudor Gothic mode. A marked departure from
historicism as well as from conventional industrial design is the 1930 Eden
Publishing Co. Building at 1712-24 Chouteau, designed by local architects
Hoener, Baum & Froese. The variegated buff brick structure, planned with
first floor retail/office use and upper story printing, introduced streamlined
Modernistic imagery while exploiting and updating the local tradition of brick
and terracotta in its chevron-patterned spandrels. First floor interior
space still retains Art Deco columns faced with black glass edged with
extruded aluminum, and custom walnut cabinetry. The publishing house had been
located on the same site since 1896.
Although there were some demographic shifts and rental housing increased,
Lafayette Square remained stable into the World War II era. In late 1962,
architect /architectural historian John Albury Bryan published a monograph
Lafayette Square: the Most Significant Old Neighborhood _i_1J_ St. Louis. Bryan,
a resident of Benton Place, acknowledged that rooming houses had become the
predominant use for the neighborhood's large, single-family houses but urged
that an ordinance be passed to limit the height of new construction and that
rehabilitation begin in Lafayette Square. A second, revised edition of
Bryan's booklet was published by Landmarks Association of St. Louis, Inc. in
1969. That same year a few new residents formed the Lafayette Square
Restoration Committee and began to work with governmental agencies in an
effort to preserve the neighborhood.

Listed in June of 1972, the Lafayette Square Historic District was the
first National Register District in the City of St. Louis; that same month the
Board of Alderman of the City of St. Louis approved the ordinance establishing
Lafayette Square as the City's first local historic district. Boundaries,
however, for the Register and City were different. Neither was based on a
comprehensive survey of the resources. Indeed, a Guide to Delineating Edges
of Historic Districts published by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation in 1976 stated in a summary paragraph dealing with Lafayette
Square:
Therefore, political and planning considerations,
rather than architectural or historical factors,
were the major determinants of Jhe north and east
1
edges of the historic district.
Nonetheless, the district represented the culmination of countless hours of
work by the growing membership of the Lafayette Square Restoration Committee,
other local supporters of historic district legislation and the staff of the
State Office of Historic Preservation.
Since that time, the foremost political determinant, a proposed
North/South distributor linking portions of the Interstate highway system, has
been debated for almost fifteen years. Although the project has not been (and
apparently never will be) funded at a level to meet Federal Highway
regulations, uncertainty about the future for the eastern portions of the
neighborhood has resulted in substantial demolition--especially on Grattan
Street where former City administrations gave more than tacit approval to
clearance. Today, the project is apparently scaled down to a moderate-speed
parkway. Although the final route is not precisely determined, the effect on
the eastern boundary of the Lafayette Square District as revised by this
nomination appears to be negligible. In the past fifteen years, Lafayette
Square has experienced tremendous revitalization, promoted by rehabilitation
initiated by both private individuals and developers. Once again, the
neighborhood is characterized by a lively mix of residents, commercial and
industrial enterprises and institutions.
