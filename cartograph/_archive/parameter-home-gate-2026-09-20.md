# The parameter-home gate — as it stood in BRIEF-field-shader + BRIEF-water-shader, 2026-09-20 (archived 2026-09-25)

> Answered 2026-09-24: `cartograph/surfaces.mjs`, `BRIEF-surface-lab §4`. The live briefs keep only the "present and correct" gate.

> ### ⭐⭐ AND THE QUESTION THAT REPLACES IT — ASK IT EXPLICITLY, IN WRITING
> *"When I decide that cornfields are a priority, have we paved the way for that or did we screw
> ourselves? We have color pickers today, but 'color' is hardly what row crops are made of."*
>
> **MEASURED 2026-09-20 — what a land-use class can carry TODAY:**
> ```
> face group in the slab :  kind · id · color · renderOrder · polygonOffsetUnits
> authorable per class   :  layerColors · luColors          ← COLOUR, and nothing else
>                           materialPhysics · materialColors ← present, EMPTY, and PBR-shaped
> ```
> ⇒ ✅ **THE RENDER SIDE IS NOT FORECLOSED.** `BakedGround.jsx`'s `GRASS_FACES` selects a whole
> shader by class id, so attaching a generator to a class is **purely additive.** The road is paved.
> ⇒ ⛔ **THE AUTHORING SIDE HAS NO SHAPE FOR IT.** There is nowhere to put row bearing, wave
> direction or stone grading, and `materialPhysics` is the WRONG SHAPE, not merely empty — a material
> says *how a surface answers light*; a generator says *what structures exist and how they are laid out.*
>
> ### ⛔⛔ SO THIS BRIEF OWES ONE THING BEFORE IT BUILDS ANYTHING
> ▶ **STATE THE PARAMETERS THIS FEATURE NEEDS AUTHORED** — name them, with units — **and say whether
> today's model can hold them.** ⚠️ **THREE OPEN BRIEFS HIT THIS SAME WALL** (`BRIEF-field-shader`
> rows/bearing/season · `BRIEF-water-shader` wave scale/turbidity/shoreline band ·
> `BRIEF-boulder-revetment` stone grading/slope/overlap).
> ⛔ **DO NOT INVENT A PARAMETER HOME. THREE BRIEFS EACH INVENTING ONE IS THE ACTUAL WAY WE SCREW
> OURSELVES** — three incompatible authoring models and no panel that can hold them. ▶ **Propose the
> shape, bring it to Boz, and it gets decided ONCE for all three.**
