# Cartograph Backlog

Last updated: 2026-04-16

Architecture: The cartograph IS the 3D scene viewed flat (orthographic top-down).
One renderer (StreetRibbons.jsx), two viewports (cartograph = flat, main app = 3D).
No separate SVG renderer. What you see in the cartograph IS what renders in the app.

## 2026-04-16 session — locked decisions

Captured before any interruption. These supersede earlier conflicting items:

1. **Defaults are Material-3 compliant until edited.** Every styleable property ships a
   sober, neutral default; the Designer is where users override. Measure-tool caustics
   stay loud but live in a separate palette (`CAUSTIC_BAND_COLORS`), never leaking into
   the rendered map. See `feedback_material3_defaults.md` (memory).

2. **Sidewalks are a default, not an operator-placed extra.** Every sidewalk-eligible
   street (residential / secondary / primary) gets a default sidewalk band filling the
   full curb-to-property-line gap. Tree lawns stay operator-placed; operator adds
   them by biting into the default sidewalk width. This supersedes
   `feedback_no_default_sidewalks.md`. **Not eligible:** service, footway, cycleway,
   pedestrian, steps — they're walking surfaces themselves. Alleys are pavement-only.

3. **Property line is survey-derivable.** `rowWidth/2 − pavementHalfWidth` from
   `survey.json` gives the authoritative per-street curb-to-property-line distance.
   Default band stacks are sized from this, not from a flat "5 ft" everywhere.

4. **Cross-section is asymmetric.** Schema: `bands: { left: [...], right: [...] }`
   on each street in ribbons.json. Up to 4 bands per half-width. Symmetric case =
   `left === right`. L/R is defined by traversing the centerline from `points[0]`
   onward; `side = +1` (matching existing `offsetPolyline`) is right.

5. **Gutter collapses into curb.** Visually indistinguishable at map scale. If the
   Designer wants to style it differently, it falls out as a stroke on the curb's
   inner edge via the layer-effects UI.

6. **Each mode has its own visual vernacular.** Subject matter (centerlines+nodes in
   Surveyor, bands in Measure, strokes in Marker) is visually dominant; aerial is
   context, not foreground. See `feedback_wysiwyg_authoring.md` (memory).

7. **One renderer.** SurveyorOverlay's private translucent `buildRibbonGeo()` is
   the two-renderer antipattern. Kill it; surveyor/measure overlays emit ONLY edit
   affordances (nodes, handles, labels). StreetRibbons renders the map beneath.

8. **Fills toggle.** Default: ribbons render at full opacity over aerial (the map is
   the subject). User can toggle fills off for aerial-only orientation.

---

## Phase X ✓ COMPLETE — Fills toggle + single-renderer detour

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| X.1 | Add `fillsVisible` store flag (default true) + toolbar toggle | done |
| X.2 | Show StreetRibbons + MapLayers in tool modes too (gated by fillsVisible) | done |
| X.3 | Delete SurveyorOverlay's private `buildRibbonGeo` + translucent ribbon meshes | done |
| X.4 | MeasureOverlay similarly — keep caustic + selected-street drag UI only | deferred (works as-is) |

---

## Phase 8 ✓ COMPLETE — Full 8-material band pipeline

Pipeline + renderer now consume `bands: {left, right}` per street. Corner bezier
preserved. Regression: a stale WebGL context was producing a "parallelogram"
render artifact after several crashes; a hard refresh / site-data clear resolved.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 8.1 | `streetProfiles.js`: Material-3 `BAND_COLORS`; caustic palette renamed `CAUSTIC_BAND_COLORS` | done |
| 8.2 | `getDefaultBandsFromSurvey(type, survey)` builds full stack incl. default sidewalk | done |
| 8.3 | `derive.js`: emit `bands: {left, right}` per ribbon street; keep `profile` for back-compat | done |
| 8.4 | Regenerate `ribbons.json` via pipeline | done |
| 8.5 | `StreetRibbons.jsx`: `sideBandsToRings()` → one ring per band; `refEdgesForSide()` (curb-inner, curb-outer, property-line) | done |
| 8.6 | Corner plug code: swap inputs to reference-edge helpers; bezier formula preserved verbatim | done |
| 8.7 | SurveyorOverlay hook-count bug from strip (moved early-return below all hooks) | done |
| 8.8 | Migrate existing `_bands` on Mississippi & Park Avenue from flat array to `{left, right}` symmetric in centerlines.json | pending — pipeline auto-symmetrizes for now |

---

## Phase 9 — Panel reorg + stroke feature + decoration split

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 9.1 | Reorganize Panel into three sections: **Street Materials / Block Fills / Map Decoration** | pending |
| 9.2 | Wire `BAND_COLORS` overrides through store → StreetRibbons reads overrides | pending |
| 9.3 | Split MapLayers decoration: `alley`, `footway`, `path`, `cycleway`, `steps` each independently toggled + colored (none get sidewalks) | pending |
| 9.4 | Layer-effects collapsible row per layer (Photoshop-style): fill color + stroke color + stroke weight + revert; collapsed by default. **No fill-visibility toggle** — designers hide a layer by matching its neighbor's color (see `feedback_styling_vs_visibility.md`). | pending |
| ~~9.5a~~ | ~~Move Fills button into Measure mode~~ — **CANCELLED**: operator wants Fills as a global orientation toggle regardless of mode (off = aerial + strokes for reality-alignment). Stays in toolbar permanently. | cancelled |
| 9.5b | Replace the 3 flat toolbar buttons (Survey / Measure / Stage) with a **3-way segmented pill** — makes "one at a time" visually explicit. | pending |
| 9.5 | Apply stroke to appropriate layers (curb, sidewalk edge, block outlines, building outlines) | pending |
| 9.6 | Measure: L/R side picker with direction-of-travel arrow (**"Side A/Side B"** not Left/Right — user rejected L/R naming as "wrong 50% of the time") | pending |
| 9.7 | Per-band material dropdown in Measure panel (so click-to-insert's auto-assigned material can be relabeled) | pending |
| 9.8 | Parallel-vs-angled parking sub-selector in Measure panel band row | pending |

---

## Phase 11 — Fold park + water into the pipeline

Retire `LafayettePark.jsx` as a separate geometry module. Park becomes just another
polygonized face with grass material + existing footway/path rendering for the paths.
Water becomes a new face type for the lagoon. Only true 3D landmarks (Arch, etc.)
stay as bespoke components.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 11.1 | Add `water` to land-use / face type vocabulary; fetch OSM `natural=water` polygons into the pipeline | pending |
| 11.2 | Render water faces in StreetRibbons face-fill system with a water material color (Material-3 default: muted blue-grey) | pending |
| 11.3 | Verify park paths from OSM `footway`/`path` already render faithfully (user-confirmed in Survey mode) — make sure decoration layers aren't hiding them | pending |
| 11.4 | Retire `LafayettePark.jsx` path/grass/fence rendering from the cartograph path; keep GatewayArch and other true landmark components | pending |
| 11.5 | Trees remain in `park_trees.json` (already decoration) — verify rendering parity | pending |

---

## Phase 12 — Material authoring: Design swatch → Stage editor

Every material (asphalt, grass, water, brick, parking, curb, sidewalk, treelawn…)
appears in the Design panel as a swatch with name + inline color picker. For deep
edits (shader, noise, tint map, texture tiling, procedural variation) the swatch
has an **"Edit in Stage →"** affordance that opens Stage pre-scoped to that material.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 12.1 | Material swatch component: name + color picker + "Edit in Stage" link | pending |
| 12.2 | Stage entry-point accepts a `?material=<id>` query param that jumps to that material in its gallery | pending |
| 12.3 | Migrate Stage's surface gallery (already built, per BACKLOG 6B.1) to be driven by the same material registry as cartograph | pending |
| 12.4 | Grass shader (already exists in LafayettePark) becomes the `grass` material's Stage view | pending |

---

## Phase 13 — Smart band populator + manual measurement snap + duplication

Note 2026-04-16: populator scope **narrowed**. Generic default is now minimal
(`asphalt + curb + sidewalk-for-eligible`, no default parking/treelawn) — the
operator captures irregular real-world cross-sections via the caustic ruler
(click-to-insert). 13.1–13.3 remain for optional smart augmentation but are
less urgent now that defaults are deliberately minimal.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 13.1 | `getDefaultBandsForStreet(tags, survey, parcels)` — consult OSM `sidewalk` tag first; fall back to street-class default | pending (optional) |
| 13.2 | Emit asymmetric `bands.left` / `bands.right` when OSM says `sidewalk=left`/`right` | pending (optional) |
| 13.3 | Parcel adjacency check — streets with no building/parcel frontage on a side (parks, rail, ramps) get no default sidewalk on that side | pending (optional) |
| 13.4 | Boundary-aware dead-end detection — endpoints near `neighborhood_boundary.json` are map exits, not cul-de-sacs. Combines with Phase 14 (divided oneways). | pending |
| 13.5 | **Snap-always on manual measurement drag-release.** | done |
| 13.6 | **Template duplication.** Measure panel "Apply this profile to…" action: operator selects a measured street, tool offers candidates (same type, similar ROW, same class) as multi-select, one click applies the band stack to all selected. | pending |

---

## Phase 14 — Divided one-ways + medians

Lafayette Square has divided one-way classes: Truman Parkway, the loop streets
(Benton Place, Mackay Place), possibly Russell and parts of Jefferson. In OSM
these are two separate `oneway=yes` ways sharing a `name`, running parallel with
a median gap. They currently break cross-section modeling and plug counts.
Update 2026-04-16: auto-detection of dead-ends was retired; caps are now
per-endpoint and operator-marked in Survey mode, so divided-road halves can be
correctly left uncapped by the operator. Phase 14 is still wanted for median
rendering and plug handling, but is no longer blocking cap re-enablement.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 14.1 | Detect divided pairs — same name + parallel + opposite `oneway` + within ~30m of each other over most of their length | pending |
| 14.2 | Emit asymmetric bands per half: outer side (toward property) = full stack; inner side (toward median) = narrow curb only, no parking, no sidewalk | pending |
| 14.3 | Median polygon emitted as its own face (`use: 'median'` or `'park'` for grass medians; `'paved'` for concrete) | pending |
| 14.4 | Suppress caps on inner-facing endpoints of each half — they're "rejoin-with-the-other-half" boundaries, not cul-de-sacs | pending |
| 14.5 | Plug logic at divided intersections: two halves meeting a cross-street = one logical intersection with 4 quadrants (not 8) | pending |
| 14.6 | ~~Re-enable cap rendering~~ — **DONE** (2026-04-16): caps are now operator-marked per endpoint; `StreetRibbons` `CAP_ENABLED = true`. | done |

---

## Phase 10 — Corner rounding, endcaps, polish

Corner plug *geometry* landed in 8.6 (proven bezier preserved, inputs rewired to
band-stack reference edges). Endcap assignment + rendering landed 2026-04-16.
Remaining work is visual validation + polish.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 10.1 | Propagate per-endpoint `capStart`/`capEnd` from `centerlines.json` through `derive.js` into `ribbons.json` | done |
| 10.2 | `StreetRibbons.jsx` renders round endcap geometry via `quarterCapRaw` per band per side. Blunt caps need no extra geometry. | done |
| 10.3 | Validate corner plugs visually across all 180 intersections — find any that look wrong with the new band-stack reference edges | pending |
| 10.4 | Verify the sidewalk×treelawn corner case: treelawn dead-ends, sidewalk fills through to form the corner curb ramp | pending |
| 10.5 | Polish the aesthetic curb stripe (`corner_curb` band) — color + width tuning via the Design panel | pending |
| 10.6 | Verify corners for streets with measured (asymmetric-capable) bands — Mississippi Avenue, Park Avenue — refs come from the correct side's band stack | pending |
| 10.7 | Corner plugs at dead-end intersections (T-intersections where one arm terminates) — special case handling | pending |

**Don't touch:** the bezier formula `ctrl = 2×mid(P0,P1) − oo`. It's proven across
all 4 quadrants with the oo↔ii distance-check swap. Only adjust *inputs* to it,
never the math itself. See `project_corner_rounding_progress.md`.

---

## Phase 0 — Cartograph as Three.js app ✓ COMPLETE

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 0.1 | cartograph.html + src/cartograph/main.jsx entry point | done |
| 0.2 | vite.config.js multi-page: serve at /cartograph | done |
| 0.3 | CartographApp.jsx: Canvas + orthographic camera + MapControls | done |
| 0.4 | Mount StreetRibbons.jsx (renders all 122 streets + face fills) | done |
| 0.5 | Verify: pan/zoom, flat rendering, full neighborhood visible | done |
| 0.6 | Aerial imagery as ground-plane texture (always mounted, toggle) | done |
| 0.7 | Port surveyor tools as Three.js overlay | done |
| 0.8 | Port marker as window-level overlay, measure as Three.js overlay | done |
| 0.9 | Master CSS (cartograph.css with token system) | done |
| 0.10 | Neighborhood boundary clipping (convex hull of buildings + 100m) | done |
| 0.11 | Camera position persists to localStorage | done |
| 0.12 | Marker as independent toggle (works in any mode) | done |
| 0.13 | Scroll wheel zoom works in all modes | done |

---

## Phase 1 — Land-use face fills ✓ COMPLETE

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1.1 | Face-fill polygons in ribbons.json (ring + land_use per face) | done |
| 1.2 | Render face fills in StreetRibbons.jsx | done |
| 1.3 | Land-use color palette | done |
| 1.4 | Verify street layers fully cover face fill at edges | not started |

---

## Phase 2 — Default rendering: pavement + curb only (SUPERSEDED 2026-04-16)

~~The system does NOT guess at sidewalks or treelawns.~~ Superseded by the Material-3-
defaults principle: sidewalks ARE a default (reality, every block has one). Tree lawns
remain operator-placed. See the 2026-04-16 session notes above, and Phase 8.

---

## Phase 3 — Surveyor → pipeline → renderer loop

When the operator edits centerlines in Surveyor mode and exits, the pipeline
rebuilds ribbons.json and the cartograph reloads with updated geometry.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 3.1 | Pipeline reads centerlines.json as primary street source | done (render.js) |
| 3.2 | Pipeline reads centerlines.json in derive.js (for polygonization + ribbons) | not started |
| 3.3 | Exit surveyor → rebuild pipeline → reload cartograph | not started |
| 3.4 | Smooth slider applies Catmull-Rom to centerline before pipeline | done (UI exists) |
| 3.5 | Pipeline reads `capStyle` (round/blunt) from centerlines.json for dead-end streets | not started |
| 3.6 | ribbons.json carries `capStyle` per street for dead-end rendering | not started |
| 3.7 | StreetRibbons.jsx renders round or blunt endcap geometry from `capStyle` | not started |
| 3.8 | Pipeline reads `_bands` (measured band stack) from centerlines.json | not started |
| 3.9 | Band stack → flat profile conversion for ribbons.json | not started |

---

## Phase 4 — Measure mode → pipeline wiring

Band stack defines per-street cross-sections. Operator composes bands visually
in Measure mode; the result flows to the pipeline and renders in the map.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 4.1 | Band stack data model (ordered array of material + width per street) | done (in centerlines.json as `_bands`) |
| 4.2 | Measure overlay: filled ribbons + caustic cross-section + draggable nodes | done (needs polish) |
| 4.3 | Code-compliant snap (sidewalk 5ft, treelawn 4.5ft, etc.) | done |
| 4.4 | Copy/paste profile between streets | done (UI) |
| 4.5 | Right-click to add treelawn/sidewalk bands | done |
| 4.6 | Band reorder/remove in panel | done |
| 4.7 | Multiple caustic keyframes per street (width varies along length) | partially done (data model ready, UI has single midpoint) |
| 4.8 | Asymmetric left/right profiles | not started (symmetric flag exists) |
| 4.9 | Batch apply: select streets → paste measured profile | not started |
| 4.10 | Measure overlay visual polish (visibility, contrast, interaction feel) | needs work |

---

## Phase 5 — Corner bands

Arm rings work. Corner bands (sidewalk merge at intersections) are designed
and the bezier formula is proven. Implementation in StreetRibbons.jsx.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 5.1 | Implement corner band mesh (proven bezier: ctrl = 2×mid(P0,P1) − oo) | not started |
| 5.2 | All material cases (sidewalk×sidewalk, sidewalk×treelawn, grass×grass) | not started |
| 5.3 | Treelawn dead-end + sidewalk fill-through | not started |
| 5.4 | Aesthetic curb stripe at corners | not started |
| 5.5 | Validate across all 180 intersections | not started |

Architecture: rings not filled, polygonOffset (positive, pushes back), FrontSide.
Winding: CCW from above (indices flipped 2026-04-15). PBR lighting, not flat shader.
DO NOT change the bezier formula. It works.

---

## Phase 6 — Stage (3D art direction tool)

Stage IS the neighborhood app with creative tools instead of app UI. Same Canvas,
same components, different overlay. To be folded into the cartograph as a mode.

### 6B — Surfaces (~50 material classes)

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 6B.1 | Surface gallery UI (tabbed: Streets, Land Use, Walls, Roofs, etc.) | done (UI only) |
| 6B.2 | Per-surface controls: color picker, roughness, emissive, texture | done (UI only) |
| 6B.3 | Surface config store + surfaces.json persistence | not started |
| 6B.4 | Wire StreetRibbons to read colors from surface store | not started |
| 6B.5 | Building wall palette (5 materials → color ranges, per-building seed) | not started |
| 6B.6–6B.9 | Neon palette, tree palette, texture maps, shader balls | not started |

### 6C — Persistence & export

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 6C.1–6C.4 | shots.json, surfaces.json, environment.json persistence | not started |

---

## Phase 7 — Production migration

Migrate Stage's clean 3D ground to the production app. Replace all SVG/CSS3D hacks.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 7.1 | Retire VectorStreets/CSS3D SVG in Scene.jsx | not started |
| 7.2–7.6 | Port StageSky, StageArch, StreetRibbons, pedestals, shadows to production | not started |

|---|------|--------|
| S.1 | Per-street undo (Cmd+Z, 50 levels) | done |
| S.2 | Split at node (two segments, same street identity) | done |
| S.3 | Dead-end endcap preview (round/blunt toggle) | done |
| S.4 | Disabled streets visible as red lines (clickable to re-enable) | done |
| S.5 | Bold nodes with dark outlines | done (needs more contrast) |
| S.6 | Add node (insert point on segment) | not started |
| S.7 | Draw new street | not started |
| S.8 | Join streets at intersection | not started |
| S.9 | Visual weight pass (everything too subtle on aerial) | needs work |

---

## Neighborhood extent (from 2026-04-15 session)

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| N.1 | Convex hull boundary from building catalog | done |
| N.2 | Boundary clipping in StreetRibbons + MapLayers | done |
| N.3 | Refine boundary via marker tool (8 zones marked) | not started |
| N.4 | Fade/vignette at edges (blocks fade, streets fade further) | not started |
| N.5 | Create missing blocks for boundary zones | not started |
| N.6 | Camera default to neighborhood center | not started |

---
